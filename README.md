## Virtual Tourist

Combining networking and Core Data, Virtual tourist is the 4th project towards Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. 

## Overview

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## Motivation

The project requires to persist a complex model using Core Data, plist persistence of an array of dictionaries and persisting data locally on a device. Storing media and retrieving it later is an essential skill for any iOS developer.
